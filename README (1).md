## Algorithms
### step 1:
 #### Roll the dice:
  The current player has to roll the dice and then a random number will be generated. If current player gets any number other than 1 on the dice then that number will be added to the current score (initially the current score will be 0) and then the new score will be displayed under Current Score section.  Note: If the current player gets 1 on the dice then the players will be switched i.e. the current player will become in-active and vice-versa.
### Step 2:
#### Hold: 
If the current player clicks on HOLD, then the Current Score will be added to the Total Score. When the active player clicks the Hold button then the total score is evaluated. If the Total Score >= 50 then the current player wins else the players are switched.
### Step 3:
#### Reset: 
All the scores are set to 0 and Player 1 is set as the starting player (current player).
